And yet, scholars have consistently noted the disjuncture between the virtual spaces such as microblogs and non-problematized notions of a free and open Habermasian "public sphere" (Dijk 2011, Rabgey 2014). As Yu notes in her study of media publics in China, even state-operated media represent "third realms" that express a "sense of in-between-ness" for citizens in their lived experiences of state and social relations (2009: 35). That is, despite the ever-present possibilities of censorship, media intersects with Tibetans' daily social lives in a manner that can provide increasing opportunities for social connection. Especially with migration for work and educational purposes, for example, chatrooms provide opportunities for Tibetans to connect with other Tibetan strangers, and establish their shared identity (Rabgey 2014: 338-339). One study conducted within the Tibet Autonomous Region also correlated the use of digital media with Tibetan teenagers' feelings of positive social connection, due to increased interaction with physically-distant family and friends (Liu et. al. 2014).

And yet, the effects of both political censorship and technological constraints on Tibetans' social media use cannot be ignored. Like the rise of Tibetan self-published serials and face-to-face discourse in semi-public spaces such as tea-houses (Rabgey 2014, Sperling 1994, Stoddard 1994), microblogs including Weibo inhibits users' self-expression, and tend to be specifically targeted for surveillance (Kaiman 2013).  Rabgey's study of newtibet.com noted censorship features including the automatic deletion of certain characters (including "Dalai"), the disappearance of the website, and its subsequent reincarnation as "China's New Tibet" or Zhongguo Xin Xizang with invitation-only access to posting and commentary (2012: 350). While the state has the ability to use cell-phone and internet jamming that can shut off all communications within a 30 mile radius (Helland 2014: 164, Ng 2013), censorship practices more common to Weibo include blocking the search function of a term as a keyword (Ng 2013: xxii-xxv), and disabling, and then later re-establishing, celebrities' pages under new names (Svensson 2009: 170). Since SinaWeibo remains a private company, this censorship may be encouraged by state-actors, but ultimately is undertaken by the company, itself.

SinaWeibo often positions itself explicitly in line with state propaganda. For example, Weibo has formulated particular methods of promoting and constraining celebrities' presence. Known as "Big V's" ("V" stands for "verification," a status given only to a select group that makes up only 0.1% of all microblog users [Svensson 2014: 177]), celebrities are explicitly encouraged to participate in social and political debate and philanthropy through Weibo.  While Weibo entices many types of celebrities (from popular culture icons to public intellectuals) to create user profiles in exchange for verification status, Weibo explicitly invites a subgroup of "Big V's", known as "opinion leaders" (&#24847;&#35265;&#39046;&#34966;) to participate in online discussing of public-interest topics on platforms called "micro-interviews." At the same time, the activities of celebrities are more closely monitored.  Following a 2013 state-level campaign to crack down on microblogs as sites of malicious "rumors," famous Weibo "Big V's" appeared on Chinese Central Television to admit the irresponsibility of their content (ibid: 171).

While it is unclear whether or not Tibetan users would be included in the category of "Big V's", Tibetan celebrities maintain a strong presence on Weibo, and seem to provoke interest beyond Tibetan communities. By examining the application program interface (API) entries for well-known Tibetan Weibo users, we analyzed three variablesâ€”number of followers, location, and language use- in order to understand how Tibetans position themselves within the new but ubiquitous virtual space of microblogs. As demonstrated in data visualization, these variables significantly interacted with each other.
