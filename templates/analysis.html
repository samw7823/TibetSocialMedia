<h3>Introduction</h3>
<b>Introduction:</b>
<p>The Internet opened to China's public in 1996, as part of a "state-centric strategy" for advancing the nation's information technology (Rabgey 2008: 340). 
Blogging took off as early as 2004, followed later by social networking sites (Chiu et. al. 2012: 2).  
Launched in August 2009, one month after the Chinese government blocked access to Twitter and Fanfou (another microblogging site resembling Twitter) (Yu et. al. 2011: 3), 
SinaWeibo emerged as a novel forum for content-sharing, networking, and debate. 
Known simply as Weibo, the site enters into, and also serves to reconstitute, a complex landscape of mass media within China.  
While most mass-media, including television and radio, is state-organized but unique to regions and provinces (Sun & Chio 2012, Yong et. al. 2012), 
Weibo is a private company that serves all of China.  
By the fall of 2010, Weibo had attracted 50 million users. 
That number would double to 100 million users by 2011, 
and to 400 million users in 2012 (Svensson 2014: 172).  
The most recent estimate of Weibo users stands at 536 million (ibid: 169).

<h3>But, how do Tibetans, who represent ethnic and linguistic minority citizens of China, participate in these virtual publics?</h3>
<p>Currently, Tibetans occupy an uneasy relationship to the Central Chinese state. 
Alongside Tibetan political movements that advocate sovereignty, 
Tibetans' self-representation within China is strongly curtailed through state-level nationalist agendas, 
especially through public displays of culture and religion (Mullaney & Anderson 2010).
And, from education, to the demographics and environmental consequences of urban development, 
to constraints on religious practice and assembly, 
policies at multiple levels of state and local governance shape Tibetans' daily lives. 
Social media increasingly enters into daily routines, as an estimated 56% of all Chinese citizens use microblogs (Svensson 2014: 169), and business reports suggest that Chinese citizens spend more than 40% of their time online on microblogs (Chiu et. al. 2012: 2). 
Given the powerful force that censorship and identity politics play in Tibetans' daily lives, 
scholars have theorized Tibetan media largely as constrained 
spaces that foster political commentary and the renewal of collective identity.
For example, in an analysis of the Tibetan-run Chinese-language blog newtibet.com, 
Tashi Rabgey (2014) explains that the content of online discourse 
centered around the meaning of "Tibet" and the role of intellectual elites in Tibetan society.
Tournadre also noted Tibetans' use of microblogs as spaces for critique of community-centered issues, 
such as Tibetan women's rights and the practice of self-immolation as political protest (2015: 81-82). 
</p>
<h3>Virual spaces</h3>
<p>
And yet, scholars have consistently noted the disjuncture between the virtual spaces such as microblogs and non-problematized notions of a free and open Habermasian "public sphere" (Dijk 2011, Rabgey 2014). As Yu notes in her study of media publics in China, even state-operated media represent "third realms" that express a "sense of in-between-ness" for citizens in their lived experiences of state and social relations (2009: 35). That is, despite the ever-present possibilities of censorship, media intersects with Tibetans' daily social lives in a manner that can provide increasing opportunities for social connection. Especially with migration for work and educational purposes, for example, chatrooms provide opportunities for Tibetans to connect with other Tibetan strangers, and establish their shared identity (Rabgey 2014: 338-339). One study conducted within the Tibet Autonomous Region also correlated the use of digital media with Tibetan teenagers' feelings of positive social connection, due to increased interaction with physically-distant family and friends (Liu et. al. 2014).
</p>
<h3>Censorship</h3>
<p>
And yet, the effects of both political censorship and technological constraints on Tibetans' social media use cannot be ignored. Like the rise of Tibetan self-published serials and face-to-face discourse in semi-public spaces such as tea-houses (Rabgey 2014, Sperling 1994, Stoddard 1994), microblogs including Weibo inhibits users' self-expression, and tend to be specifically targeted for surveillance (Kaiman 2013).  Rabgey's study of newtibet.com noted censorship features including the automatic deletion of certain characters (including "Dalai"), the disappearance of the website, and its subsequent reincarnation as "China's New Tibet" or Zhongguo Xin Xizang with invitation-only access to posting and commentary (2012: 350). While the state has the ability to use cell-phone and internet jamming that can shut off all communications within a 30 mile radius (Helland 2014: 164, Ng 2013), censorship practices more common to Weibo include blocking the search function of a term as a keyword (Ng 2013: xxii-xxv), and disabling, and then later re-establishing, celebrities' pages under new names (Svensson 2009: 170). Since SinaWeibo remains a private company, this censorship may be encouraged by state-actors, but ultimately is undertaken by the company, itself. 
</p>

<h3>Censorship: celebrities</h3>
<p>
SinaWeibo often positions itself explicitly in line with state propaganda. 
For example, Weibo has formulated particular methods of promoting and constraining celebrities' presence. 
Known as "Big V's" 
("V" stands for "verification,"" a status given only to a select group that 
makes up only 0.1% of all microblog users [Svensson 2014: 177]), 
celebrities are explicitly encouraged to participate in 
social and political debate and philanthropy through Weibo.  

While Weibo entices many types of celebrities (from popular culture icons to public intellectuals) to create 
user profiles in exchange for verification status, 
Weibo explicitly invites a subgroup of "Big V's", known as "opinion leaders" 
(&#24847;&#35265;&#39046;&#34966;) to participate in online discussing of public-interest 
topics on platforms called "micro-interviews." 
At the same time, the activities of celebrities are more closely monitored.  
Following a 2013 state-level campaign to crack down on microblogs as sites of malicious "rumors," 
famous Weibo "Big V's" appeared on Chinese Central Television to admit 
the irresponsibility of their content (ibid: 171). 
</p>
<h3>"Big V's"</h3>
<p>
While it is unclear whether or not Tibetan users would be included in the category of "Big V's", Tibetan celebrities maintain a strong presence on Weibo, and seem to provoke interest beyond Tibetan communities. 
By examining the application program interface (API) entries for well-known Tibetan Weibo users, 
we analyzed three variables- number of followers, location, 
and language use- in order to understand how Tibetans position themselves 
within the new but ubiquitous virtual space of microblogs.
As demonstrated in data visualization, these variables significantly interacted with each other.
</p>
<p>
Each variable also provoked questions for further research, as described below:
</p>
<h3>Celebrity Presence</h3>
<p>
Our users fell into two main categories: lamas, and other celebrities including film-makers and music artists.
These celebrities were all located in urban places, and had between 1,080 (a musician, &#27901;&#26106;&#25289;&#22982;&#30340;&#38081;&#26438;&#31881;&#19997;) and 12,532,516 followers (a lama,&#21152;&#25514;&#27963;&#20315;).
The celebrities with the highest and lowest number of followers were both based in Lhasa.
Most celebrities come from younger generations, and seek out followers from their own generation;
Weibo use represents a cutting-edge, trendy method of representing celebrities' images and accumulating fans.
